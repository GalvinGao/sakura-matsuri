It’s getting warmer slowly but surely. I hope everyone is in good health.

The Japanese Program at Franklin & Marshall College plans to host a “Sakura (Cherry Blossom) Festival” on Saturday, March 25. We want to share Japanese and Asian cultures with our students, faculty, staff, and members of the Lancaster community. And we hope to provide the opportunity for everyone to enjoy this Japanese celebration in the style of a festival.

At the festival, our student bands will perform Japanese songs. We also invited the KyoDaiko drum performing group from Philadelphia to demonstrate traditional drum performance.

In addition, there will be many booths organized by the students of the Japanese Program, F&M First Year Cabinet, and members of Lancaster Japanese Association to introduce Japanese festival culture. Such booths include free tasting of cotton candy, choco-banana, and green tea.

Also, visitors can enjoy kimono wearing, _kendama_ (traditional Japanese toy) and a chopsticks game. We will sell Sakura Festival T-shirts and traditional indigo-dye products made by students and faculty of F&M as well. Visitors are also invited to participate in mochi-making and Bon-odori (Bon-dance).

We want to thank the International Studies Program, Oka Asian Fusion, and YUZU Asian Cuisine for their financial support. In addition, Lancaster Japanese Association and Lancaster Asian American Pacific Islanders (LAAPI) kindly agreed to assist us in planning, promoting, and hosting the event.

Thank you very much!

We hope you will join us in the Lancaster premier of the Sakura Festival and have a pleasant time. We look forward to meeting you on the afternoon on Saturday, March 25.
